所念皆星河     
所爱隔山海
满目星河不可及     
星辰大海皆似你

你的眼睛很好看
里面藏着星辰大海
我的眼睛也很好看
也藏着星辰大海
因为我满眼是你
你就是我的星辰大海

脑海里所想皆是你
遥不可及的你
想你的时候
就抬头望星辰
星河滚烫，你是人间理想
皓月清凉，你是人间曙光
人海冷漠，你是人间炽热

一瞥便是惊鸿 
芳华乱了浮生
可叹惊鸿一瞥
误入眉眼 
欢喜多年

All I read are stars

Love across the sea

It is far beyond reach

Stars and seas are like you



You have nice eyes

It hides the stars and the sea

I have nice eyes, too

Hiding the stars and the sea

Because my eyes are full of you

You are my star sea



All I can think about is you

Far away from you

When I think of you

He looked up at the stars

The stars are boiling hot, you are the world ideal

The bright moon is cool and refreshing, you are the dawn of the world

The sea of indifference, you are the world hot



A glance is a glance

Youth makes a mess of life

A sighing glance

Eyebrow eye contact

For many years with joy
